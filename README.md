# text_filtering_on_keywords
This is a code that can be used to filter projects or applications with a particular theme, given by keywords. You need to type your server, your database, your query and the name of the theme keywords that you want to search the projects for. The advantage of this code over SQL query is that you can make it as an executable file or web graphic interface, thereby useful for multiple themes search and can be delegated to people without knowledge of SQL.
